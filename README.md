# Boston_Marathon_Analysis
Excel, file: marathon_results_2015.xlsx
In this exploration, I examined the 2015 Boston Marathon Dataset from Kaggle in order to uncover data on demographics, finishing time, and average pace per country and the United States specifically. I used pivot tables in Excel in order for users to find what average pace they would need to need to maintain over the Boston Marathon in order to finish in a certain placement. This included a pivot chart which roughly shpwed  a linear correlation between pace and placement.  I also created a table that allows users to filter by demographics such as age, gender, country to see the average pace, finiishing time, for the selected filters. There is also a table that would allow users to view who ran the fastest male and female time for each country. 

Tableau, file: 2015 Boston Marathon Exploration.twbx 

In order to view this file you must download it and open it in the tableau desktop app as public tableau wasn't working. I created a dashboard which would allow users to filter by gender and country. One of the visuals is a map of the USA/World where you can see the density of runners from what cities they came from in order to participate in the Boston Marathon. We can see that runners come from all over the United States but with a heavy focus in the North East as it is local to the area. Given that a significant proportion of participants in the Boston Marathon come from the Northeast, how can we strategically target underrepresented regions to promote the Boston Marathon brand and create additional revenue streams or satellite events, considering the event is already over capacity from applications.
